I"Ï<p>Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre happy to announce that today we‚Äôre releasing Nushell 0.3.0. Nu has seen numerous bugfixes, performance improvements, and features added since its initial public release (which was only a few weeks ago!)</p>

<h1 id="where-to-get-it">Where to get it</h1>

<p>Nu 0.3.0 is available as <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.3.0">pre-built binaries</a> or from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nu">crates.io</a>. If you have Rust installed you can install it using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cargo +nightly install nu</code> (or if you want all the features <code class="highlighter-rouge">cargo +nightly install nu --all-features</code>).</p>

<h1 id="whats-new">What‚Äôs new</h1>

<h2 id="new-table-design-porges-jonathandturner">New table design (Porges, jonathandturner)</h2>

<p><img src="http://jonathanturner.org/images/utf8_table.png" alt="Table with utf8 box drawing" /></p>

<p>One of the most striking differences is that Nu now uses UTF-8 box drawing to draw its tables.</p>

<p><img src="http://jonathanturner.org/images/utf8_light_table.png" alt="Table with utf8 box drawing in light mode" /></p>

<p>The table is also configurable. If you feel like the table is a bit too heavy, you can also configure it to work in light mode using this command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; config --set [table_mode light]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="new-file-formats-pmeredit-est31-andrasio-jonathandturner">New file formats (pmeredit, est31, andrasio, jonathandturner)</h2>

<p>Nu now natively supports new file formats, including: bson, tsv, sqlite, and url-encoded strings.</p>

<h2 id="new-commands-incrop-ramonsnir-ijt-jonathandturner-andrasio-jonnywalker81-chhetripradeep-pka">New commands (incrop, ramonsnir, ijt, jonathandturner, andrasio, JonnyWalker81, chhetripradeep, pka)</h2>

<p>Since the 0.2.0 release, Nu has gained a set of additional commands, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code> - built-in help system</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">reverse</code> - reverse a table</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">last</code> - like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">first</code> command, but working from the bottom of the table, return n rows</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">embed</code> - create a new table using the current table as a start</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> - get the contents of a URL (this originally lived in <code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> - post to a URL and get the results</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> - print the working directory</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">env</code> - give access to a number of important paths and environment settings</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">pivot</code> - pivot a table so that rows become columns and vice-versa</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> - a built-in echo command</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="error-improvements-jonathandturner">Error improvements (jonathandturner)</h2>

<p><img src="http://jonathanturner.org/images/did_you_mean.png" alt="Improve error messages" /></p>

<p>We‚Äôve made steady progress on improving error messages. Recently, we added ‚Äúdid you mean?‚Äù errors to help when you mistype the name of columns. Nu 0.3.0 also has gone through a few passes to generally polish the errors to include more information when an error occurs.</p>

<h2 id="shell-features-pka-wycats-twe4ked-andrasio-iamcodemaker">Shell features (pka, wycats, twe4ked, andrasio, iamcodemaker)</h2>

<p>Nu now supports <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code> to refer to your home directory as part of a path.  You can also use <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd -</code> to return to a previous directory you were working in.</p>

<p>The shell itself also got a few updates. You can now enable ‚Äòvi‚Äô mode, if you‚Äôd prefer vi-like bindings (by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">config --set [edit_mode vi]</code>). On non-Windows platforms, you can also use Ctrl-R to enable Sublime-style history searching (we‚Äôre hoping to enable Windows support for this soon).</p>

<h2 id="plugin-improvements-jonathandturner-andrasio">Plugin improvements (jonathandturner, andrasio)</h2>

<p>Plugins have continued to mature, and it‚Äôs now possible to use plugins to extend Nu with support for new file formats.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve also added documentation on how to <a href="https://github.com/nushell/contributor-book/blob/master/en/plugins.md">write Nu plugins in both Rust and Python</a>, with info on Ruby coming soon.</p>

<h2 id="docker-support-vsoch-drsensor">Docker support (vsoch, DrSensor)</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in using Nu and Docker together, be sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/master/docs/docker.md">new Docker support</a>.</p>

<h2 id="book-progress">Book progress</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://book.nushell.sh">Nu book</a> is now available in <em>three</em> languages: English, Spanish, and Japanese.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve also created a <a href="https://github.com/nushell/contributor-book/blob/master/en/README.md">Nu contributor book</a>, which will help developers who want to contribute to Nu learn about its philosophy, design, and how to create plugins.</p>
